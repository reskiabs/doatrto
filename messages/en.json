I desperately wanted to feel happiness and peace within myself. I used to frequently explode in anger and had extreme fears. During major protests in Indonesia, I always fled abroad, restless and unable to sleep. Even when abroad, I spent nights closely monitoring events in Jakarta. I kept praying to God for help and answers while continuously seeking a solution.",

    "answerContent": "Finally, God answered my prayers. Exactly 10 years later, every piece of the puzzle and question was complete, marking the beginning of Divine Oracular Assistance (D.O.A), the answer to my long prayers. Initially, I used this technique to solve my own life's problems and it worked! Now, my life is calm, happy, full of peace. Not a day passes without a sincere smile and gratitude for the blessings I receive, and my family has reunited harmoniously."
